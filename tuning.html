<h1>
Tuning your bow
</h1>
<br>
<br>
<h2>
Tested and proven tools - an important step on the road to success
</h2>
<p>
    If you want to become a good shooter, or if you already are, and you want to be a little better, or if your goal is the highest of all goals - the Olympic gold medal team and the opportunity to win - you should understand the tools of testing and adjusting the importance of the role. Every small building block to expressly provide, and the whole is made to meet personal technique. This - as we already know, separated from the second shot - and this is the reason for tuning.
    Long skinny shooter may not be able to hit the same tools and controls as a short and skinny.
<br>
<br>
    Bow should be considered first. It should be the length of your bet oikan over. Neither too long nor short. With a short drive, short enough to be repurchased in the spring, so that the spring blades taipuisivat enough and would give the best possible energy arrow throwing. Long-driven shooter should again draw attention to the fact that he would bow long enough to prevent the tendon angle shot full puristaisi bet too much pull your fingers together. Blades should be long enough so that the throwing / benefit ratio is maintained, but the fingers are pinched together.
    Strength of the bow (pounds) shall not be never more than what the shooter strength to pull. It's no secret that can yes to pull more than able to control and shoot accurately. Strength of the spring may also serve as a judge it, how much control you have left, while two thirds of competition in the shot. The last third of it may be, when you need more control, you force the spring - to get high scores. However, I think that you should use every pound - which are able to maintain control.
    You and your coach should be to find out what is the power which are able to control. It is not difficult and it should be done. Stay honest in this choice. Some of us are shooting with a bow too loose because they are either lazy or believe that they can use heavier. Others shoot too stiff spring, mostly because their ego will not allow them to use a lighter. If you have a burden for even one pound over, what does it achieve? Everything has a price.
    The interests of all the possible use of force are the speed, direction of the arrow below the flight path, errors in a lesser impact, and cleaner trip. Also, while shooting in the wind power is beneficial. Too much - too little - but not nicely. What, then, to know what is enough. By trying out different things, and long-term results.
    Similarly, the physical weight of the bow may not be any more of what jaksat control. I also believe that the muscles engage and strengthen the support to this important part of the bow handle area would be better hallinnassa.Olen read somewhere that the spring will not work properly anymore, if it is added too much weight. This has not been proven yet, but I subscribe to the argument.
<br>
<br>
    Gunner personalized just for you on the bow grip is very important. Its size and shape to contribute to the loss of shooting decisively. Does not seem reasonable, if large handed heavy-shooter to use a small narrow handle, or vice versa. Most handles are now reasonably good, and exchanged a huge advantage. Some shooters prefer a low, some high and some of the handle in between. If the back of the handle is too smooth, it can cause excess torque in hand. Too round back again does not fit all hands. Choose a handle that appeals to you and feel good, and then stay there.
<br>
<br>
    The arrows represent a problem for most shooters because they make them so or thus or else someone else is doing it to them. In most cases, the fault is not nuolissa. We all seem to be under the impression that we need exactly what some of those good shooters are using. Is not necessarily so. Good shooters also use such tools to which they are tuned to fit their individual technique.
    There are a lot of shooters who are able to tune and test its medium peak stage. There are also shooters who do not care one iota effort to find out what types of stance they ought to shoot and what would suit their own technology. They did not bother to bother to tune instruments, even with a good tuner should be next.
    In some areas, unfortunately, is not no man who could these skills. I know one area that has a very good tuning specialist, but he does not apply to other instruments. In an area other hand, is similar to an expert who provide everything you can see, right. You should look for someone who knows how to adjust your equipment, if you do not want to learn. (The press and the books are good articles on the subject)
<br>
<br>
    If you know someone who is good tuners, you may want to sacrifice a bit of time and money while traveling with him. It's not a long run down the drain. Sometimes even a professional can be hired for their services. Such a person tunings and expertise can be trusted.
    Let's say that you shoot today, good bundles and the arrow flies and hits well. If after a week, all tunings are in the same way, but the arrow is no longer bundle, not a good person to blame välineitäsi area. First check ammuntatekniikkasi. Error in technique may be an arrow generally behave restlessly. Tuning is usually very difficult for a shooter in which the technology is not okay. Tuning tweaks should be done only after the shooting technique is a good model.
    If you want good shooter, or team, it requires that your equipment has been tested and tuned to work correctly with your technique.

    Until Arc spring base adjustment
<br>
<br>
    We start from the premise that we have a shooter who has started his hobby, shot some time, the club's fleet and will now buy the first own tools.
    What do you have at this point to know and take into account?
    Length of the shooter's bet
    - Resolves an optional spring length of the rule of thumb, less than 27 "in spring 1966," 27-30 "spring 68" over 30 "Spring 70"
    - Solves the spring in conjunction with the power of the arrow used deflection value
    Strength of the spring
    As already stated during initialization, it is very important that the cable is just the right amount of paunoja 1 pound (usually marked lb or lbs) is about 0,454 kilos.
    Arrows and arrow supply table reading / comprehension
    Should carefully consider what kind of arrows are currently makes sense to invest. The arrows are not cheap and they are especially in the beginning "consumable". We always recommend buying a full dozen at a time. Initially, not to invest large sums of money in expensive carbon fiber and yhdistelmänuoliin, cheaper to learn the necessary technology.
<br>
<br>
    Spring perusviritysten Making
<br>
<br>
    When you start to adjust the basic instrument, the first point is to look for spring jänteelle nokinpaikka and watch the arrow right haritus. These basic adjustments eliminate the largest arrow on the vertical and lateral oscillations. Note. Attach jouseesi all the necessary accessories, bridge, arrow shelf, etc., before starting to adjust. Fix always only one thing at one time. Not all at the same time.
<br>
<br>
    Start by masking nokinpaikka such a height can easily be varied. A suitable starting point is about 1.3cm sormiampujalle, 0.63cm trigger device uses (measured jänteeltä arrow shelf height upwards). This control is always executed first. It eliminates the direction vertical oscillation.
<br>
<br>
    Arrow harituksen adjustment. Mark off the bow the shoulders for example, adhesive tape or pieces of the alignment, using the shoulder center point (center of the main spans taljajousessa). Place the arrow jänteelle and shelf and see the alignment spring back. Make the necessary corrections to the horizontal direction of the arrow shelf or pulley spring changing the position. Sormiampujalla harituksen should be 1/16-1/8 inch outside the line taljajousessa tendon directly to the tendon behind the laukaisulaiteampujalla. This adjustment eliminates the arrow sivuheilahtelua and fine-tuned to tällänen often changing the spring force. Also, changing the weight of an arrowhead and the spring force adjustment will often help the matter.
<br>
<br>
    Adjust the arrow shelf. Especially thin and high-speed carbon fiber or a combination of arrows are used, they clean the arrow shelf bypass is important. Adjust nuolihyllysi so that when viewed from the top shelf, the yarn does not appear on the arrow below. Bundling is a good pass and the flight stability is of paramount importance.
    Sulattoman arrow test is recommended to use the arrow and vertical sivusuuntaheilahtelujen fine-tuning. Bypass is recommended for checking powder or lipstick.
    <br>
    <br>
        Right span
<br>
<br>
    ääntelyyn spring is a common cause of false span. Each vastakaarijousesta is usually 2 to span height. Another area of tolerance and the other at the top. Spring manufacturer will usually bow Handbook span a recommendation which is for example 81 / 2 - 91 / 2 ". Tendon should be used, so long that it gives unthreaded span 81 / 2" em.jousessa.
    Then the right span should start testing the shooting, adding patrols, by taking notes and feel of the spring vote. At some point usually tärppää. Spring beats steadily and smoothly. The sound is good and quiet. Here is your bow the right span. The correct way to handle the Assistant Rapporteurs of the deepest point tendon. (Usually the same dimensions as the bridge-span)
<br>
<br>
    Tiller, ie a balance between the shoulder blade and is a measure of the spring frame of the confluence of the tendon and tendon measuring instrument for a 90-degree angle.
    There are two types of till items which affect the dynamic tiller bow stroke smoothness. (Ts.lavat hitting at the same time)
    Static tiller in turn affects the spring tähdättävyyteen full bet. Ylälavassa example, if you have more power than alalavassa it will seek to stay in a match race "after" and creates a target-term gain, and vertically unstable tähtäyskuvan. Shoulders (strength) paunansäätöruuveista provides a balance and it is easy when used as a criterion-term movement during the pull.
    If the bow is an older model ts.siinä not adjustable blades, till you can change the items by changing the angle of the blade in one piece have prepared for this purpose (hard plastic works well), which sets the stage and bow frame.
<br>
<br>
    Elasticities, ie below PLUNGER
<br>
<br>
    Allan elasticities is intended to soften the blow bow an arrow against the body of the detachment of the spring. It will also be provided in exactly the right arrow haritus.
    Elasticities of the lack of bow and arrow TUNING THE INSTRUMENT. Bow and arrow should stemmata exactly the shot even without the flexibility trampling. Allan elasticities launch is aimed at minimizing errors that occur and differences. Elasticities below should not be too tight nor too loose.
    Fast carbon fiber and composite arrows are not very critical tällänen stiffness, instead of aluminum arrows are a lot more accurate. Aluminum arrow and take-bundling is essential for fourth round of adjustment while in one direction or another round does not affect esim.ACE X10 arrows or just about anything.
    I did a test with an arrow ACE tällänen sisäänpainumisesta keskijäykkyydelle and the bridge went down just inside n.0, 8mm. Elasticities Below is a mechanical device that needs regular maintenance. It's worth it from time to time to open, and clean out the grease, especially during the summer, if there is a shot in the rain.
<br>
<br>
    Vakaajajärjestelmä of stabilizers
<br>
<br>
    Stabilizers role is primarily to stabilize the flexible Aim and arrow out to sea, as well as the alternative, the spring absorbs recoil direction of the arrow has left already.
    If we look at more flexible without stabilizers, we can see that it will move in two different directions. Ylälapa spring will hit back strongly and alalapa forward. Spring will also pyärähtämään vertical axis. When the bow is added keskivakaaja, it discourages both liikeitä.
    V-bar and viiksivakaajia used etuvakaajan counterweight. Counterweight can also add a spring inside the handle down. However, the V-bar also prevents the spring sivuttaisheilahtelua. The main stabilizers tuning the focus is keskivakaajan head, whose business is launched should be restrained. If the stabilization part by weight of bounce launched a substantial upward, there should be added to the weight or the angle of the mustache should be counted. If you feel like the sight, aiming at more restless, you can add jouseesi ylävakaajan. It shifts the focus of higher bow and usually calms term movement. Vakaajajärjestelmään spring may also increase the shock absorbers, springs that calm beats and hiljentävät votes.
    When using a fast lightweight carbon fiber or a combination of arrows, stabilizers should be as rigid and vibrate at high frequency, so that they are able to react fast vibration direction of the arrow. Possible suppressor should then be placed only between the stabilizer and weight. (Doinkkeri)
    Slowly vibrating aluminum arrows for suppressor can also be a frame / v-bar, and stabilizer in between.

<h3>
    BASIC CONTROLS OF COMPOUND BOW
</h3>
    Tow Length:
<br>
<br>
    This may sound simple but the pulley can be flexible (and considered by many to be) to shoot a hand spring elbow bent, and this makes finding the correct length of pull a little confusing. A very direct hand in the spring is not good, so slightly bent is a good starting point ...
    Elbow slightly bent to give a better wind management. It is also advantageous terrain while shooting uphill or downhill because it transferred more weight on the right lines and the shooting is pleasant. For example being able to shoot himself with a tensile springs vary in length from 31 "- 25". In this scale should be in front, of course, points where the shooting is a particularly nice touch. 29.5 "and 27 3 / 4" work particularly well. Also, the stroke of close to 26 "works somehow. Comfortable points for wearing comfort, therefore, that the arm muscles of settling the case correctly. I'm not an expert on muscle issues but I know this works. If you want to experiment with a bent elbow bow hand, do not shorten the only 1 / 4" or 1 / 2 ". Try it now 2 "or 3".
    <br>
    Strength of the spring:
<br>
<br>
    Most of my male shooters shoot from 1950 to 1960 paunaisella. FITA's max is 60lbs. Most of the women while using 35 and 45lbs in between. There is no particular reason to shoot some specific pounds. Many shooters say they shoot 55 lbs in a given jousityypillä. If this spring tune esim.58 lbs strength, it seems difficult to keep stable, aiming at. If the power again to drop 52 lbs is the same thing. Once again, it seems that there are certain points where a particular string will work.
    These two things muokkaantuvat own experiences. Power adjustment may change when the string is tuned to a particular nuolelle.
 <br>
 <br>
    Middle-firing:
<br>
<br>
    Arrow shelf is there only one right place laterally and this is the real center of the tendon behind. If you wait nuolesi coming out of the bow in a straight line, has a shelf to be exactly the tendon behind the shot. Suoralapaisessa cable is well prepared for this measurement is easy to perform. Just put the pieces of masking tape on the shoulders of wheels and the frame halfway. Measure the distance from the platform side idler pulley in the middle and pass this measure of masking tape. Place the arrow on the back burner and viewed from the rear line of the bow tendon tekemiisi marks. Move then nuolihyllyä sideways so that the arrow is exactly behind the tendon when the tendon is aligned with the marks.
<br>
<br>
    The timing wheel:
<br>
<br>
    The only correct way to get the wheels to hit at the same time is to measure the wheels of the spring at rest, and also a full bet. You may have a shoulder that runs faster than another, because one of the bike can be a little tighter than the other. If the wheel is not the right timing does not lead the cable stay in place during the shooting. It causes nokinpaikan rise and fall. Sometimes the arrow leaves the origin at the top, sometimes bottom spring. Bad timing wheels are a common cause of impure arrow flight.
   Measured on a spring at rest. It should be done at a specific location jänteeltä wheel. The best way to check the wheel operation is to tie a strong thread to the point to which the tendon of the device usually comes with strings. Put your feet on wire A level loop and start to drag a flexible job with the light onto the handle of the point where the pressure to jousikätesi. Pull the string so the full breath and check that both cables will be decided at the same time his point. If you do not have vetostoppareita, marking the full veto pen to mark kaapeleihisi.
<br>
<br>
    Nokinpaikat:
<br>
<br>
    Use only ylänokinpaikkaa or if you want to use is also lower, so make it as small as possible. Use this if you shoot punoslankaa rope device. If you use a good hiilikuitunuolta nokinpaikan ylänokinpaikan starting height is the bottom 10mm. (As measured by the arrow shelf height upwards) or alumiininuolilla n.12mm.
